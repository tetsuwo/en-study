> Hold on little girl  
> Show me what he's done to you  
> Stand up little girl  
> A broken heart can't be that bad
> 
> When it's through, it's through  
> Fate will twist the both of you  
> So come on baby, come on over  
> Let me be the one to show you
>
> (I'm the one who wants to be with you)  
> (Deep inside I hope you feel it too)  
> Feel it too  
> (Waited on a line of greens and blues)  
> Waited on a line  
> Just to be the next to be with you
>
> Build up your confidence  
> So you can be on top for once  
> Wake up who cares about  
> Little boys that talk too much
>
