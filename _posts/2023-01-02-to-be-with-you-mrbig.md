### To Be With You - Lyrics

> Hold on little girl  
> Show me what his done to you  
> Stand up little girl  
> A broken heart can't be that bad  
> When it's through, it's through
> Fate will twist the both of you
> So come on baby, come on over
> Let me be the one to show you
>
> I'm the one who wants to be with you
> Deep inside I hope you feel it too
> Waited on a line of greens and blues
> Just to be the next to be with you
