### Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life) の歌詞

> Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road  
> Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go  
> So make the best of this test and don’t ask why  
> It’s not a question, but a lesson learned in time  
> It’s something unpredictable, but in the end it’s right  
> I hope you had the time of your life
> 
> So take the photographs and still-frames in your mind  
> Hang it on a shelf in good heath and good time  
> Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial  
> For what it’s worth, it was worth all the while
> 
> It’s something unpredictable, but in the end it’s right  
> I hope you had the time of your life
> 
> It’s something unpredictable, but in the end it’s right  
> I hope you had the time of your life
> 
> It’s something unpredictable, but in the end it’s right  
> I hope you had the time of your life
