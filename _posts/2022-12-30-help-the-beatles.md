### Help! Lyrics

> (Help!) I need somebody  
> (Help!) Not just anybody  
> (Help!) You know I need someone  
> Help!
> 
> When I was younger so much younger than today  
> I never needed anybody's help in any way  
> But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured  
> Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors
> 
> Help me if you can, I feeling down  
> And I do appreciate you being around  
> Help me get my feet back on the ground  
> Won’t you please, please help me
> 
> And now my life has changed in oh so many ways  
> My independence seems to vanish in the haze  
> But every now and then I feel so insecure  
> I know that I just need you like I’ve never done before  
> 
> Help me if you can, I feeling down  
> And I do appreciate you being around  
> Help me get my feet back on the ground  
> Won’t you please, please help me
> 
> When I was younger so much younger than today  
> I never needed anybody’s help in any way  
> But now these days are gone, I’m not so self assured  
> Now I find I’ve changed my mind and opened up the doors
> 
> Help me if you can, I feeling down  
> And I do appreciate you being around  
> Help me get my feet back on the ground  
> Won’t you please, please help me  
> Help me! Help me! Ooh


### 和訳

> (Help!) I need somebody  
> Help! Not just anybody  
> Help! You know I need someone  
> Help!

(Help!) 誰かが必要なんだ  
(Help!) 誰でも良いわけじゃないんだ  
(Help!) 分かるだろ、誰かが必要なんだよ  
Help!

> When I was younger so much younger than today  
> I never needed anybody's help in any way  
> But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured  
> Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

僕が今よりももっと若かった頃のこと  
僕は誰の助けも必要としてなかった  
でも今これらの日々は過ぎ去り、僕は自信をなくしたよ  
見つけたんだ、心に変化があったんだ、そしてドアを開けたんだ

> Help me if you can, I feeling down  
> And I do appreciate you being around  
> Help me get my feet back on the ground  
> Won’t you please, please help me

助けられるのなら助けてよ、落ち込んでいるんだ  
傍にいてくれるなら感謝するよ  
地に足をつけるから助けてよ  
どうかお願いだから助けてよ

> And now my life has changed in oh so many ways  
> My independence seems to vanish in the haze  
> But every now and then I feel so insecure  
> I know that I just need you like I’ve never done before

僕の生活は色々と変わってしまった  
僕の自立心は霧の中に消え去ったんだ  
でも度々とても不安になるんだ  
わかってるさ、僕は君を必要としているんだ、いままでにないくらい
