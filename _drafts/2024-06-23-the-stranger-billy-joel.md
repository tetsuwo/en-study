### 歌詞

> Well, we all have a face  
> That we hide away forever  
> And we take them out  
> And show ourselves when everyone has gone  
> Some are satin, some are steel  
> Some are silk and some are leather  
> They're the faces of a stranger  
> But we'd love to try them on  
>
> Well, we all fall in love  
> But we disregard the danger  
> Though we share so many secrets  
> There are some we never tell  
> Why were you so surprised  
> That you never saw the stranger  
> Did you ever let your lover  
> See the stranger in yourself  
>
> Don't be afraid to try again  
> Everyone goes south every now and then  
> You've done it  
> Why can't someone else  
> You should know by now  
> You've been there yourself  
>
> Once I used to believe  
> I was such a great romancer  
> Then I came home to a woman  
> That I could not recognize  
> When I pressed her for a reason  
> She refused to even answer  
> It was then I felt the stranger  
> Kick me right between the eyes  
>
> Well, we all fall in love  
> But we disregard the danger  
> Though we share so many secrets  
> There are some we never tell  
> Why were you so surprised  
> That you never saw the stranger  
> Did you ever let your lover  
> See the stranger in yourself  
>
> Don't be afraid to try again  
> Everyone goes south every now and then  
> You've done it  
> Why can't someone else  
> You should know by now  
> You've been there yourself  
>
> You may never understand  
> How the stranger is inspired  
> But he isn't always evil  
> And he is not always wrong  
> Though you drown in good intentions  
> You will never quench the fire  
> You'll give in to your desire  
> When the stranger comes along  


### 和訳

> Well, we all have a face  
> That we hide away forever  
> And we take them out  
> And show ourselves when everyone has gone  
> Some are satin, some are steel  
> Some are silk and some are leather  
> They're the faces of a stranger  
> But we'd love to try them on  

だれにでも顔はある  
永遠に見つからないように隠す  
でもそれを取り出す  
そして


> yyyyyyyyyyyy

YYYYYYYYYY


### 解説

> Well, we all have a face  
> That we hide away forever  
> And we take them out  
> And show ourselves when everyone has gone  
> Some are satin, some are steel  
> Some are silk and some are leather  
> They're the faces of a stranger  
> But we'd love to try them on  

#### hide away

直訳すれば「離れて隠す」とか「別のところへ隠す」だと思いますが、「（見つからないように）隠す」という意味だそう。

ということで「永遠に見つからないように隠す」としました。


> yyyyyyyyyyyy

YYYYYYYYYY
