### 歌詞

> There is no combination of words I could put on the back of a postcard  
> No song that I could sing but I can try for your heart  
> Our dreams and they are made out of real things  
> Like a shoebox of photographs with sepia-toned loving  
> Love is the answer, at least for most of the questions in my heart  
> Like why are we here? And where do we go? And how come it's so hard?  
> It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving  
> I'll tell you one thing, it's always better when we're together  
> 
> Mmm, it's always better when we're together  
> Yeah, we'll look up at stars when we're together  
> Well, it's always better when we're together  
> Yeah, it's always better when we're together  
> 
> And all of these moments just might find their way into my dreams tonight  
> But I know that they'll be gone when the morning light sings  
> Or brings new things, for tomorrow night you see  
> That they'll be gone too, too many things I have to do  
> But if all of these dreams might find their way into my day to day scene  
> I'd be under the impression I was somewhere in between  
> With only two, just me and you, not so many things we got to do  
> Or places we got to be, we'll sit beneath the mango tree now  
> 
> Yeah, it's always better when we're together  
> Mmm, we're somewhere in between together  
> Well, it's always better when we're together  
> Yeah, it's always better when we're together  
> 
> I believe in memories  
> They look so, so pretty when I sleep  
> Hey now and, and when I wake up  
> You look so pretty sleeping next to me  
> But there is not enough time  
> And there is no, no song I could sing  
> And there is no combination of words I could say  
> But I will still tell you one thing  
> We're better together
