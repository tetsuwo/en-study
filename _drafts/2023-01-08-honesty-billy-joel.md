> If you search for tenderness  
> It isn’t hard to find  
> You can have the love you need to live  
> But if you look for truthfulness  
> You might just as well be blind  
> It always seems to be so hard to give  
> 
> Honesty is such a lonely word  
> Everyone is so untrue  
> Honesty is hardly ever heard  
> And mostly what i need from you  
> 
> I can always find someone  
> To say they sympathize  
> If i wear my heart out on my sleeve  
> But i don’t want some pretty face  
> To tell me pretty lies  
> All i want is someone to believe  
> 
> Honesty is such a lonely word  
> Everyone is so untrue  
> Honesty is hardly ever heard  
> And mostly what i need from you  
> 
> I can find a lover  
> I can find a friend  
> I can have security until the bitter end  
> Anyone can comfort me with promises again  
> I know, I know  
> 
> When I’m deep inside of me  
> Don’t me too concerned  
> I won’t as for nothing while I’m gone  
> But when i want sincerity  
> Tell me where else can I turn  
> ‘Cause you’re the one I depend upon  
> 
> Honesty is such a lonely word  
> Everyone is so untrue  
> Honesty is hardly ever heard  
> And mostly what I need from you
